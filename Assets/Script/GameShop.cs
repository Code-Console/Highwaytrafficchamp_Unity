2:35 PM
Yogesh Bangar
ok
we implement IAP and ADS
HS
2:37 PM
Harshit Solanki
IAP and Ads will by default come with any project i give you, it is my basic requirement, and along with that UI and a shop where upgrades can be made, or IAP products purchased.
2:37 PM
Yogesh Bangar
OK
HS
2:37 PM
Harshit Solanki
these things are my basic and a compulsory requirement which comes with any project i give you.

2:38 PM
Harshit Solanki

Try to be one of the fastest drivers in the global leaderboards.
HS
2:39 PM
Harshit Solanki
and one last thing, all my projects will have to be developed for Android and IOS by default
i will check this game of yours, downloading it
meanwhile go and have lunch, sorry i took a little longer than expected
come back after lunch, i will keep a project ready for you
and one more thing, if a project is similar to what you have already developed. then it should not take much time for you to develop it since you already would be having the template, art work assets etc with you, right?
2:44 PM
?
2:44 PM
Yogesh Bangar
I will not help you to IAP upload on game center IOS because it takes too much time for review for IAP
HS
2:44 PM
Harshit Solanki
meaning?
IOS IAP is very essential, as the mainstream revenue for any game comes with IOS IAP products only
anyways we can look into that in future
please answer my previous question!!
2:46 PM
Yogesh Bangar
I upload my app on game center but they not approve my IAP
but i will implement IAP for IOS and Android in game
HS
2:47 PM
Harshit Solanki
cool
2:47 PM
Yogesh Bangar
we will not take long time to complete game
HS
2:47 PM
Harshit Solanki

HS
4:39 PM
Harshit Solanki
yes this is the one
4:39 PM
Yogesh Bangar

HS

Harshit Solanki
i want a mix of then both with a few added elements of my own
4:39 PM
Yogesh Bangar

HS
4:41 PM
Harshit Solanki
so the concept of the game is there will be a bike race with various locations to play from
4:42 PM
Yogesh Bangar
Ok
HS
4:42 PM
Harshit Solanki
players can buy different bikes from the shop
4:42 PM
Yogesh Bangar

Harshit Solanki
bikes will have a pre set configuration, which will indicate its speed, handling and acceleration
3 pre sets only, and bike are NOT upgradable, they can only be bought with cash,(coins which act as the in game currency to make purchases)
clear so far!!
4:46 PM
Yogesh Bangar
Yes
HS
4:46 PM
Harshit Solanki
any questions regarding this?
4:46 PM
Yogesh Bangar
what about resources?
HS
4:46 PM
Harshit Solanki
meaning?
resources for?
bikes?
4:46 PM
Yogesh Bangar
I will you my own graphics
yes
Bike and background
HS
4:47 PM
Harshit Solanki
as i had mentioned, i dont have a designer, she met with an accident, so i am relying on you for all the graphical assistance for the game
4:47 PM
Yogesh Bangar
Ok I will Use my Own
HS
4:48 PM
Harshit Solanki
and assuming you already have all the artwork related to the game, so you can change their properties, shape, size, color and make new assets using the old ones and use them for my game project
4:48 PM
Yogesh Bangar
what should be game name
HS
4:48 PM
Harshit Solanki
regarding backgrounds also!!
4:48 PM
Yogesh Bangar
?
HS
4:48 PM
Harshit Solanki
well i have not thought about that yet
i want to first discuss about the gameplay
make you understand what i want
4:49 PM
Yogesh Bangar
OK
HS
4:49 PM
Harshit Solanki
once you are clear with my requirements, and know what you have to build for me then we can think of a game name and the other little things which come in the end!
for now, this much is clear, i need a bike racing game
various locations
player vs other AI players in a bike racing game
the race game will be different than what you have built, because, here the racers or the players, will try to hurt, hit and try to take the rider out by using weapons
4:52 PM
weapons like baseball bat, bike chains
players can also kick other bike players with their leg
a program will identify the damage taken by a player and once that damage reaches 0, the player will fall of the bike, and will restart at the same spot where it fell.
clear so far?
have you played that old game in computer called ROADRASH?
4:55 PM
you there?
4:55 PM
Yogesh Bangar
yes i played that game
Its req player animation it will take time to make animation
at 3D artist end
baseball hit animation and kick animation
HS
4:56 PM
Harshit Solanki
yeah thats cool
i can give you sufficient amount of time to build the game
4:56 PM
Yogesh Bangar
and its all about new game at my end
HS
4:59 PM
Harshit Solanki
meaning?
yes this game will be different than what you have built in terms of game play, but you dont have to worry because the way i see it, you already have all the assets present to make this game
the way i see it, you dont have to build anything from the scratch!!
5:01 PM
feel free to state your queries!!
or should i move on?
5:01 PM
Yogesh Bangar
Okay i will start the game...
I will update you with gameplay on monday evening...
HS
5:02 PM
Harshit Solanki
update me?
about?
5:02 PM
Yogesh Bangar
gameplay APK
i stating working in game
okay?
HS
5:03 PM
Harshit Solanki
look before you make a prototype, listen to all my queries!!
my requirements!!
5:03 PM
Yogesh Bangar
ok
HS
5:03 PM
Harshit Solanki
i have to talk about the upgrades
ads
IAP products
so the basic gameplay features you have understood
5:04 PM
Yogesh Bangar
yes
HS
5:04 PM
Harshit Solanki
the user will be rewarded with cash(the in game currency)
cash can be used to buy bikes
5:05 PM
Yogesh Bangar
How to get cash
HS
5:05 PM
Harshit Solanki
cash is earned as a reward for completing the race
5:06 PM
Yogesh Bangar
this is endless game right?
HS
5:06 PM
Harshit Solanki
if the user finishes in the first 3 position of the race the user is awarded cash
there will be 2 game modes in this
endless and time bases
based*
5:07 PM
Yogesh Bangar
ok
HS
5:07 PM
Harshit Solanki
in endless mode, the user will be targeting to cover as much as distance as possible
the distance tracker program will display the user how much distance they have survived, at the end of the race when user is knocked off the bike, or hit by an obstacle, the user is rewarded cash for their efforts
much like in the moto rush game, where the user is rewarded and shown how much distance they have covered
5:09 PM
Yogesh Bangar
ok
HS
5:10 PM
Harshit Solanki
2nd mode will be a time trial, where the user has limited time to race and try and finish in the first 3 position
only if the user is in top 3, they will earn cash
clear so far!! (edited)
5:12 PM
Yogesh Bangar
Yes
HS
5:12 PM
Harshit Solanki
understood the game modes
any doubts?
5:12 PM
Yogesh Bangar
for IAP and ads ?
New Messages
HS
5:12 PM
Harshit Solanki
ads will be only Rewarded video ads, they are non skippable
5:13 PM
Yogesh Bangar

admob reword ads?
HS
5:14 PM
Harshit Solanki
yes coming to that
unity video ads and admob reward ads
2 ad agencies
5:14 PM
Yogesh Bangar
ok
HS
5:14 PM
Harshit Solanki
coming to when the ads can be shown, 1st in endless mode, if the user is knocked down, an ad pop asking the user to revive from the same spot by watching am ad
2nd instance, when a user successfully earns a reward in endless or time trial, on ad pop up will be displayed asking the user to double up their earned rewards by watching an ad video
5:17 PM
3rd instance, after every 2 gameplay attempts, be it endless or time trial, an ad will be displayed automatically
3 instances where ads are going to be displayed
5:17 PM
Yogesh Bangar
OK
HS
5:17 PM
Harshit Solanki
